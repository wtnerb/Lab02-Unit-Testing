# ATM in the Console
## Overview
This app simulates the behavior of an atm in the console. You can check your balance, withdraw money or even (though atms don't let you do this) deposit money.

## Use
Once compiled the app should be simple to run. You will need to press return at the end of each input. Don't add tabs or spaces to your input. Your balance will only display when specifically requested for security purposes. Attempting to depost/withdraw negative money and attempting to withdraw more money than you possess will throw exceptions that cause the transaction to fail without crashing the app. Same with attempting a transaction with a non-monetary value. The money input will trim whitespace if needed, but don't depend on that.

## Example
Starting view:
```
Which action would you like to take? +
1. View Balance
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Quit

```
To check your balance (which does have a default starting value) your input should be `1` and the `return` key. That will bring you to view the starting balance and ask for a keystroke to continue. At that point, just follow the prompts in the app.

## Architecture
The deposit, withdraw and view balance portions of the app utilize test driven development and the xunit package.
